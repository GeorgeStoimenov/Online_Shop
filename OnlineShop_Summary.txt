For completing the task I've choosen ASP.NET MVC pattern, HTML and CSS. 
First I created the Product class, then an interface called "IProductRepository" and a class "ProductRepository" which implements the interface.
The Product Controller's contructor requires an object that needs to impelemt the "IProductRepository" interface, using dependency injection, the service in StartUp class tells that "ProductRepository" instance should be created.
I've created a database, which for the purpose of the task is created every time the application is started.
The database is created and filled with data by the "SeedData" class. 
The data is passed to the View method, I've created a view page called "index.cshtml" to display the data.
The "_layout.cshtml" display the navigation bar, background picture and the footer.
